# C-Compiler-In-C
Hey there here is an c compiler in c language with a little optimization like cout and cin from c++/cpp

# How was it created?
The Lexer works opun flex and the parser created with the help of bison

# Commands
flex "lexer files *.lex"
bison "parser files *.y"
gcc "output *.c file"
./a

# Attention
I didn't have enough time to make it but here is the Lexer and a little malfunctioned Parser

To run the project you need GCC, Flex and Bison
